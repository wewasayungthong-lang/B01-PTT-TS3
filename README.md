# HyTalkPTT

HyTalkPTT is an Android application that enables a configurable physical PTT (Push-To-Talk) button to activate the HyTalk application. It works with Motorola LEX F10, UROVO DT30, Ulefone, and other devices whose PTT keycode you configure in the app. **External Bluetooth PTT microphones** are supported as well — for example **Inrico BT02** and similar headsets that deliver PTT over Bluetooth (HFP vendor / AVRCP / media keys, depending on the device). A **dedicated BLE PTT button** (**PTT-Z01**, e.g. YPC21) is supported via Bluetooth Low Energy scan, GATT connection, and notify on the manufacturer’s FFE0/FFE1 characteristic (press = `0x01`, release = `0x00`).

## Overview

The app intercepts PTT button presses and converts them into broadcast intents that HyTalk recognizes. It uses an **Accessibility Service** to capture global key events and sends `android.intent.action.PTT_DOWN` and `android.intent.action.PTT_UP` broadcasts. The PTT keycode is stored in app preferences (default **228** for Motorola LEX F10) and can be changed via **Configure PTT Key** in the app.

**Setup order matters:** enable **Accessibility** for HyTalkPTT first (otherwise key events are not delivered to the app), then **Configure PTT Key**, then optional **Configure Programmable Keys (for Motorola)** on supported devices.

## Requirements

- **Devices**: Motorola LEX F10 (default keycode 228), UROVO DT30, Ulefone (26WT, 20WT, 18T, etc.), or any device with a configurable PTT keycode; **external Bluetooth PTT mics** (e.g. Inrico BT02 and similar) when the phone exposes their PTT to apps (see below); **BLE PTT button PTT-Z01** when Bluetooth LE scan/connect permissions are granted (see [BLE PTT button (PTT-Z01)](#ble-ptt-button-ptt-z01))
- **Android**: Android 5.1.1 (API 22)
- **Target app**: HyTalk (`com.hytera.ocean` / `com.hytalkpro.ocean` where applicable)
- **Android Studio**: Latest with Android SDK

## Features

- **Accessibility-based capture**: Global PTT handling requires HyTalkPTT to be enabled under **Settings → Accessibility** before keys are intercepted.
- **Configurable PTT keycode**: Set via **Configure PTT Key** (press your hardware PTT → Save). Default 228 (Motorola LEX F10).
- Intercepts only the configured PTT key and converts it to broadcast intents for HyTalk
- **Bluetooth PTT** (optional): external mics and headsets — HFP hook, AVRCP media keys, and **HFP vendor-specific** events (used by devices such as **Inrico BT02**). Enable **Bluetooth headset / microphone PTT** in **Configure PTT Key** and tap **Save settings**.
- **BLE PTT button PTT-Z01** (optional): LE scan by advertised name, GAP device name check when available, subscribe to **FFE1** notify. Enable **BLE PTT button (PTT-Z01)**, **Search**, connect, then **Save settings** to store the MAC; the app reconnects on startup while the option stays saved on. **Tap to toggle transmit** applies to this source too when enabled (same setting as for Bluetooth media keys).
- Automatically launches or brings HyTalk to foreground when PTT is pressed
- Works when the app is in the background or was killed
- Minimal resource usage

## Setup Instructions

Configure these steps **in this order**:

### 1. Accessibility Service (do this first)

1. Open **HyTalkPTT** from the launcher.
2. Tap **Configure Accessibility** (first button on the main screen).
3. In **Settings → Accessibility**, find **HyTalkPTT** and **enable** the service.
   - **Android 13/14/15 + APK sideload:** if you see "restricted settings", open **App info** for HyTalkPTT, tap **menu (⋮)**, choose **Allow restricted settings**, then return to Accessibility and enable HyTalkPTT.

Without this step, the app cannot receive global PTT key events.

### 2. Set PTT Key code

1. Return to **HyTalkPTT** and tap **Configure PTT Key**.
2. Press your device’s physical PTT button and/or enable **Bluetooth headset / microphone PTT**, **Bluetooth SPP**, and/or **BLE PTT button (PTT-Z01)** as needed (for BLE: turn the button on, grant scan/connect and location if prompted, **Search**, wait for connect, then Save).
3. Tap **Save settings**.

The app stores the keycode (e.g. 228 for LEX F10, 520–522 for UROVO DT30, 381/301/131 for Ulefone). You can change it anytime by repeating these steps.

### 3. Configure Programmable Keys (for Motorola)

1. In **HyTalkPTT**, tap **Configure Programmable Keys (for Motorola)** (opens system Settings).
2. Go to **Settings → Programmable Keys** (path may vary by device).
3. Set **PTT Key app** (or equivalent) to **HyTalkPTT**.

This helps the device deliver PTT events when locked or in the background (where supported).

## External Bluetooth PTT microphones (e.g. Inrico BT02)

Support has been added for **external Bluetooth PTT microphones** that work like a dedicated radio-style PTT button over Bluetooth. Examples include **Inrico BT02** and **similar** models from Inrico or other vendors, provided the Android Bluetooth stack forwards their events to apps.

- In **Configure PTT Key**, enable **Bluetooth headset / microphone PTT** and **Save settings** (until you save, Bluetooth capture is not active).
- Some radios (e.g. **Retevis / Ailunce HD2** over Bluetooth) send **PLAY/PAUSE** as a **very short pulse** (DOWN+UP in a few milliseconds), so HyTalk only sees a “click”, not a hold. Enable **Tap to toggle transmit** in Configure PTT Key: **first tap** = start PTT, **second tap** = stop (no periodic `PTT_DOWN` in toggle mode; normal press-to-talk over Bluetooth still uses keepalive while the key is held). Leave toggle off for headsets that send a real key hold.
- Depending on the mic, PTT may arrive as **AVRCP** (play/pause), **HFP hook**, or **vendor-specific HFP** frames (e.g. `+XEVENT` / `TALK` press and release). The app maps these to the same `PTT_DOWN` / `PTT_UP` broadcasts as the hardware key.
- If nothing appears when you press PTT, the device may use a **proprietary protocol** that Android does not expose — in that case use the phone’s own programmable PTT key or another mic model.

**Debug / proximity on HD2 (and similar):** the app logs Bluetooth probe lines with tag **`HyTalkPTT-BtProbe`** (vendor HFP `VENDOR_SPECIFIC`, `MEDIA_BUTTON` extras, and `KeyEvent` from MediaSession vs accessibility). Capture while touching the sensor:

```bash
adb logcat -v time 'HyTalkPTT-BtProbe:I' 'PTTAccessibilityService:D' '*:S'
```

(Quote `*:S` in zsh.) Compare finger-on vs finger-off lines; vendor AT commands may use a different company id than 85 — the **action-only** vendor receiver logs those without the category filter.

If you **hear a short tone in the earpiece** when touching a **proximity sensor** but **no `HyTalkPTT-BtProbe` lines** appear, the headset is almost certainly handling the sensor **inside its own firmware** (local audio feedback only). Android apps then receive **no** separate key or vendor event for that gesture — HyTalkPTT cannot map it unless the manufacturer exposes a documented Bluetooth command stream.

## BLE PTT button (PTT-Z01)

Supported model: **PTT-Z01** (advertised name; manufacturer reference **YPC21**). This is **Bluetooth Low Energy**, not classic headset AVRCP.

1. In **Configure PTT Key**, enable **BLE PTT button (PTT-Z01)**.
2. Turn the button on (battery). Grant **Bluetooth scan** and **Bluetooth connect** on **Android 12+**; on older versions the OS may require **location** (fine or coarse) for LE scan — accept when prompted.
3. Tap **Search for PTT-Z01**. The app scans for that name, connects, reads **GAP Device Name** (`0x1800` / `0x2A00`) when present to confirm **PTT-Z01**, then enables notifications on **FFE0** / **FFE1** (`0x01` = pressed, `0x00` = released).
4. Tap **Save settings** so the device address is stored and BLE stays enabled after you leave the screen. Clearing the BLE checkbox and saving removes the stored device and disconnects.

**Background operation:** BLE routing attaches to the same host as classic Bluetooth PTT — either **PTTAccessibilityService** (when accessibility is on) or **BluetoothPttService** (when only Bluetooth/BLE/SPP sources need a foreground-capable host). If accessibility is off but **only** BLE (or SPP) is enabled, the coordinator starts **BluetoothPttService** so reconnect still works.

**Logs:** tag **`BlePttZ01`** for scan, GATT, and subscribe events.

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (latest)
- Android SDK API 22 (compile SDK is intentionally 22 for legacy device support)
- JDK 8+

### Build steps

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chepil/HyTalkPTT.git
   cd HyTalkPTT
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio and sync Gradle.

3. Build and install:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```
   Or: **Build → Make Project**, then **Run → Run 'app'** with the device connected via USB (USB debugging enabled).

### Gradle commands (reference)

```bash
./gradlew installDebug          # build and install debug APK
./gradlew assembleRelease       # release APK → app/build/outputs/apk/release/
./gradlew clean
./gradlew lint                  # fails on NewApi / incompatible API use
```

Release APK naming pattern: `HyTalkPTT-v{versionName}-{versionCode}.apk` (see `app/build.gradle`).

## How It Works

```
Hardware PTT (and/or Bluetooth media keys / BLE FFE1 notify)
         ↓
PTTAccessibilityService.onKeyEvent() / MEDIA_BUTTON / BlePttZ01Controller  ← Accessibility + MediaSession + GATT
         ↓
    ├─ Broadcast: PTT_DOWN / PTT_UP → HyTalk (com.hytera.ocean, …)
    └─ startActivity when PTT pressed — bring HyTalk to foreground
```

1. **Accessibility**: `PTTAccessibilityService` must be enabled so the system can deliver filtered key events (`android:canRequestFilterKeyEvents="true"`).

2. **Configured PTT keycode**: Stored in **SharedPreferences** (prefs name `ru.chepil.hytalkptt.ptt_prefs`, key `ptt_keycode`; default **228**). Set in **Configure PTT Key**.

3. **Key paths**: Global `KeyEvent`s for the configured hardware key; Bluetooth via `MediaSession`, legacy `registerMediaButtonEventReceiver`, and vendor HFP where supported; BLE via `BlePttZ01Controller` (LE scan, `BluetoothGatt`, FFE1 notify → same broadcast path as other PTT sources).

4. **Broadcast intents**: `ACTION_DOWN` → `android.intent.action.PTT_DOWN`; `ACTION_UP` → `android.intent.action.PTT_UP` (explicit package when resolved).

5. **MainActivity ↔ service**: static volatile `MainActivity.isPTTButtonPressed` for launcher / PTT flow coordination.

6. **HyTalk** listens for these broadcasts; the app launches or raises HyTalk when PTT is pressed.

### Main classes

| Class | Role |
|-------|------|
| `PTTAccessibilityService` | Intercepts keys, optional `InputManager` injection (API 23+), sends broadcasts, Bluetooth routing, BLE attach host |
| `MainActivity` | Setup UI, accessibility / PTT key / programmable keys shortcuts |
| `PttKeySetupActivity` | Learn keycode, Bluetooth / SPP / BLE source toggles, LE search, Save |
| `PttPreferences` | SharedPreferences wrapper for keycode and PTT sources (including BLE device address) |
| `BlePttZ01Controller` | LE scan, GATT connect, FFE1 notifications, reconnect when BLE PTT is saved on |
| `BluetoothPttCoordinator` | Starts `BluetoothPttService` when classic Bluetooth, SPP, and/or BLE PTT is enabled and accessibility is off |

## Technical Details

- **minSdkVersion / compileSdkVersion**: 22 (Android 5.1.1). **targetSdkVersion**: 36. **Java**: 8.
- **UI**: No AndroidX — `appcompat-v7:22.2.1` (version must match compile SDK).
- **MainActivity**: `android:launchMode="singleTask"`.
- **Package**: `ru.chepil.hytalkptt`

## Compatibility safeguards

The project is tuned for older rugged devices (e.g. LEX F10 on 5.1.1). Do **not** raise `compileSdkVersion`, `minSdkVersion`, or `appcompat-v7` without testing on real hardware.

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Dependabot ignore rules | Blocks risky upgrades to `appcompat-v7` / major AGP |
| Lint `NewApi` (error) | Fails build if code uses APIs above `minSdkVersion` |
| CI APK checks | Validates `minSdkVersion` in built APK |
| Gradle dependency locking | Reduces transitive drift |

After dependency changes:

```bash
./gradlew dependencies --write-locks
./gradlew clean assembleRelease
./gradlew lint
```

See `.github/compatibility-baseline.yml` for the documented baseline.

## Permissions

- **BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE**: For intercepting key events.
- **BLUETOOTH**: Declared so some OEM Bluetooth stacks deliver headset-related broadcasts.
- **BLUETOOTH_ADMIN**: Legacy BLE scan support on older stacks.
- **BLUETOOTH_CONNECT** / **BLUETOOTH_SCAN**: Android 12+ connect and scan (runtime where required).
- **ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** / **ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION**: LE scan on many devices when Android links scan to location (runtime on API 23+); both are declared so lint and Play policy align with coarse-only grants.
- **SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW**: Optional, not used currently.

## Troubleshooting

### PTT button has no effect

1. Enable **Accessibility** for HyTalkPTT (**Configure Accessibility** on the main screen).
2. Set **Configure PTT Key** (press PTT; enable Bluetooth PTT, SPP, and/or BLE PTT-Z01 if needed, then Save).
3. On Motorola-type devices, use **Configure Programmable Keys (for Motorola)** and set **PTT Key app** → HyTalkPTT.
4. Check logcat:
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep -i "HyTalkPTT\|PTTAccessibilityService"
   ```

### Debug: PTT end-to-end trace

One-screen timeline (accessibility + Bluetooth + broadcasts):

```bash
adb logcat -s HyTalkPTT-PTTTrace:I HyTalkPTT-MediaBtn:I PTTAccessibilityService:D MainActivity:D
```

Reproduce your issue (e.g. cold-start HyTalk → PTT on → PTT off). You should see `broadcast PTT_DOWN` / `PTT_UP` when the app sends intents.

- **`onKeyEvent SAVED_PTT_KEY` … `willHandle=false`**: the physical key reached the accessibility service but is ignored (e.g. only Bluetooth source enabled in settings).
- **No `SAVED_PTT_KEY` while pressing the side PTT**: Android did not deliver that keycode (foreground app / OEM); Bluetooth may still appear as `HyTalkPTT-MediaBtn` / `dispatchBluetoothMediaKey`.
- **UP missing** while Bluetooth toggle: HyTalk in foreground often steals AVRCP until routing is reclaimed; see service logs for `reclaim AVRCP routing` if using tap-to-toggle.

### HyTalk doesn’t launch

1. Install HyTalk (`com.hytera.ocean` or your build’s package).
2. Check logcat for launch errors.

### Wrong key detected

- Open **Configure PTT Key**, press your PTT, confirm the shown keycode, then **Save settings**.  
- On some devices, PTT may use different keycodes (e.g. 520, 521, 522 for UROVO DT30).

### UI: checkboxes hard to see (dark theme)

- The PTT setup screen uses a dark background; checkboxes use an explicit light tint so they stay visible. If anything is still unclear, use system **Display** settings or increase brightness.
